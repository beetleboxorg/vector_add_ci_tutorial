# vector_add_ci_tutorial

This repository contains example code to build and run a vector addition project in Vitis. 

Take note of what each branch contains:

The main branch is set up to build and run software emulation, hardware emulation and hardware.

The swemu branch is set up to build and run software emulation.

The hwemu branch is set up to build and run hardware emulation.

The hardware branch is set up to build and run on physical hardware. 

The hardware prebuilt requires the user to input a prebuilt sd card image to run on hardware directly, without the need to build.
